# Critical hit

All damaging moves with damage calculated through base power have a chance to critical hit, which multiplies the damage dealt by 1.5. If the move's user has the [[Sniper]] Ability, damage from a critical hit is again multiplied by 1.5. Additionally, if the user's attacking stat stage is less than 0, it will be treated as 0; the same is true if the target's defensive stat stage is greater than 0. If the target has Reflect, Light Screen, or Aurora Veil active, those effects are ignored.

Most moves start at a critical hit ratio of +0, although high critical hit ratio moves (like [[Stone Edge]]) start at +1, [[10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt]] starts at +2, and [[Frost Breath]] and [[Storm Throw]] always result in a critical hit.

| Ratio | Rate   | Percentage |
|------:|:------:|-----------:|
| +0    | 1/24   |       4.2% |
| +1    | 1/8    |      12.5% |
| +2    | 1/2    |      50.0% |
| +3    | always |     100.0% |

Items that increase critical hit ratio:

- [[Razor Claw]]: +1
- [[Scope Lens]]: +1
- [[Stick]]: +2 ([[Farfetch'd]] only)
- [[Lucky Punch]]: +2 ([[Chansey]] only)

Abilities that increase critical hit ratio:

- [[Super Luck]]: +1
- [[Merciless]]: +3 (only if the target is poisoned)

Temporary effects that increase critical hit ratio:

- Focus Energy effect: +2 until switch-out, granted by:
    - [[Focus Energy]]
    - Z-[[Foresight]]
    - Z-[[Sleep Talk]]
    - Z-[[Tailwind]]
    - Z-[[Acupressure]]
    - Z-[[Heart Swap]]
    - [[Lansat Berry]] when eaten

- Laser Focus effect: +3 until the end of the next turn, granted by:
    - [[Laser Focus]]

Note that the Focus Energy effect doesn't stack with itself - you can only have one Focus Energy effect at a time.

Critical hits are prevented from striking a Pokemon under the effect of [[Lucky Chant]], as well as Pokemon with the [[Battle Armor]] and [[Shell Armor]] Abilities.

### Past gens

Gen 6:

At +0, critical hit rate was 1/16 instead of 1/24.

Gen 2-5:

The critical damage multiplier was 2 instead of 1.5, and the critical hit rates were as follows.

| Ratio | Rate   | Percentage |
|------:|:------:|-----------:|
| +0    | 1/16   |       6.3% |
| +1    | 1/8    |      12.5% |
| +2    | 1/4    |      25.0% |
| +3    | 1/3    |      33.3% |
| +4    | 1/2    |      50.0% |

Gen 2 only:

The attacking stat stage and defensive stat stage were considered as a collective unit, and either both treated as 0 or both left as their full value, depending on whether their sum was less than 0. 

High-critical-rate moves were given a starting ratio of +2 rather than +1.

Gen 1:

The critical modifier of 2x was applied onto the level, as opposed to the final damage. As such, at level 100 it effectively became a multiplier of 82/42x, or about 1.95x. 

Critical hits always caused all stat stages on both sides to be treated as 0, regardless of whether that was slated to result in more or less damage.

Critical rate was calculated by default as the attacker's base speed divided by 512.

For high-critical-rate moves such as [[Slash]] or [[Razor Leaf]], the rate instead uses base speed divided by 64, with a maximum of 255/256.

Focus Energy did not function properly at all, and after using it, the critical rate on all subsequent moves until switch-out was divided by 4.

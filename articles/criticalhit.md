# Critical hit

All damaging moves with damage calculated through base power have a chance to critical hit, which multiplies the damage dealt by 1.5. If the move's user has the [[Sniper]] Ability, damage from a critical hit is again multiplied by 1.5.

Most moves start at a critical hit ratio of +0, although high critical hit ratio moves (like [[Stone Edge]]) start at +1, and [[10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt]] starts at +2. [[Frost Breath]] and [[Storm Throw]] always result in a critical hit.

| Ratio | Rate   | Percentage |
|------:|:------:|-----------:|
| +0    | 1/24   |       4.2% |
| +1    | 1/8    |      12.5% |
| +2    | 1/2    |      50.0% |
| +3    | always |     100.0% |

# Phazing

Phazing moves are moves that make the opponent switch out, including [[Whirlwind]], [[Roar]], [[Dragon Tail]], and [[Circle Throw]]. These moves always come with a high negative priority (currently -6) for balance reasons, due to the disruptive effect they would have if they were routinely capable of going first and denying the opponent access to any of their turns.

The word "phaze" is short for "pseudo-Haze", since they're similar to [[Haze]] in that they reset stat boosts.

Note that the Ability [[Suction Cups]] and the effect of [[Ingrain]] prevent phazing, though Pokemon with [[Mold Breaker]], [[Turboblaze]], or [[Teravolt]] can ignore the former.

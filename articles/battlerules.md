# Battle Rules

## Endless Battle Clause

- Any Pokémon hit by a foe’s [[Heal Pulse]] or [[Floral Healing]] becomes stale.
- Any Pokémon _using_ (consuming) an _acquired Leppa Berry_ (defined as a [[Leppa Berry]] which the Pokemon did not start the battle with, for example, one obtained via [[Fling]], [[Trick]], [[Harvest]], [[Recycle]], [[Bug Bite]], [[Pluck]], [[Pickup]] etc) becomes stale.
- If all Pokémon on the field are stale and at least one team does not have the option of switching to a non-stale Pokémon, with at least one side's Pokémon's staleness having been inflicted by a Pokémon of the opposing side, the game ends. If only one side started the battle with the _rudimentary means to perform Leppa Berry-cycling_ (defined to be a team containing a Pokémon holding a [[Leppa Berry]] and a Pokémon with [[Recycle]] or [[Harvest]] or [[Pickup]], it loses, otherwise the battle ends in a tie.
- The maximum length of any battle is 1000 turns, after which the game ends in a tie.
